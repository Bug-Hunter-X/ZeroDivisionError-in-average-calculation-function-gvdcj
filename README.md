This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: a `ZeroDivisionError` that can occur when calculating the average of a list of numbers. The `bug.py` file contains code with this error, and the `bugSolution.py` file demonstrates how to fix it by handling the case of an empty list.

The bug is caused by dividing the sum of numbers by the length of the list without checking if the list is empty.  If the list is empty, `len(numbers)` will be 0, resulting in division by zero. This is addressed in `bugSolution.py` by adding a conditional statement to check for an empty list and return 0 in that case.
